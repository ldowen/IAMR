   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to IAMR's documentation!
================================
IAMR is a parallel, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code that uses
subcycling in time and solves the 
variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of
complex geometries.
It is built on top of AMReX, a publicly available software framework designed for building
massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.

Active development in IAMR is ongoing in the development branch. 
Changes are merged into the master branch at the beginning of each month.

For an AMReX-based incompressible flow code without subcycling in time, please go to
